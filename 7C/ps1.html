      <h3>Following are the features of NoSQL database</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type: square">
        <li>
          <b>Schema agnostic</b>A database schema is the description of all
          possible data and data structures in a relational database. With a
          NoSQL database, a schema isn’t required, giving you the freedom to
          store information without doing up‐front schema design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Nonrelational</b>Relations in a database establish connections
          between tables of data. For example, a list of transaction details can
          be connected to a separate list of delivery details. With a NoSQL
          database, this information is stored as an aggregate — a single record
          with everything about the transaction, including the delivery address.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Commodity hardware</b>Some databases are designed to operate best
          (or only) with specialized storage and processing hardware. With a
          NoSQL database, cheap off‐the‐shelf servers can be used. Adding more
          of these cheap servers allows NoSQL databases to scale to handle more
          data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Highly distributable</b>Distributed databases can store and process
          a set of information on more than one device. With a NoSQL database, a
          cluster of servers can be used to hold a single large database.
        </li>

      <h3>Following is a discription list consisting of cricket teams</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><b>Indian men's cricket team</b></dt>
        <dd>
          Traditionally much stronger at home than abroad, the Indian team has
          improved its overseas form, especially in limited-overs cricket, since
          the start of the 21st century, winning Test matches in Australia,
          England and South Africa. It has won the Cricket World Cup twice – in
          1983 under the captaincy of Kapil Dev and in 2011 under the captaincy
          of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. After winning the 2011 World Cup, India
          became only the third team after West Indies and Australia to have won
          the World Cup more than once, and the first cricket team to win the
          World Cup at home.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>India women's national cricket team</b></dt>
        <dd>
          the first women's Test was played between England and Australia.
          However, women's cricket arrived in India much later; the Women's
          Cricket Association of India was formed in 1973. The Indian women's
          team played their first Test match in 1976, against the West Indies.
          India recorded its first-ever Test win in November 1978 against West
          Indies under Shantha Rangaswamy's captaincy at the Moin-ul-Haq Stadium
          in Patna.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Australia men's national cricket team</b></dt>
        <dd>
          The Australia men's national cricket team represents Australia in
          men's international cricket. As the joint oldest team in Test cricket
          history, playing in the first ever Test match in 1877, the team also
          plays One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I)
          cricket, participating in both the first ODI, against England in the
          1970–71 season and the first T20I, against New Zealand in the 2004–05
          season, winning both games. The team draws its players from teams
          playing in the Australian domestic competitions – the Sheffield
          Shield, the Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament and
          the Big Bash League.
