              The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007, with funding
              provided by Zee Entertainment Enterprises.[13] The ICL was not
              recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or
              the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the BCCI were not
              pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive
              board.<br />To prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI
              increased the prize money in their own domestic tournaments and
              also imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL, which was
              considered a rebel league by the board.

              On 13 September 2007, the <strong>BCCI </strong>announced the
              launch of a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition called
              Indian Premier League whose first season was slated to start in
              April 2008, in a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI
              vice-president Lalit Modi, said to be the mastermind behind the
              idea of the IPL, spelled out the details of the tournament
              including its format, the prize money, franchise revenue system
              and squad composition rules. It was also revealed that the IPL
              would be run by a seven-man governing council composed of former
              India players and BCCI officials and that the top two teams of the
              IPL would qualify for that year's Champions League Twenty20. Modi
              also clarified that they had been working on the idea for two
              years and that the IPL was not started as a "knee-jerk reaction"
              to the ICL. The league's format was similar to that of the Premier
              League of England and the NBA in the United States. To read more,
