          <p>
            The Department of Electrical Engineering came into existence as a
            separate department from the year 1955 for the Diploma and Batchlor
            degree course.The PG degree course started in the year 1972. At
            present, the academic curricula involve 6-semester diploma,
            8-semester graduate B.E. degree course and 4-semester postgraduate
            M.E. degree course in Electrical Engineering in two fields of
            specialization. The department also offers research programmes
            leading to Ph.D. degree through scholarships from AICTE
          </p>

            The department possesses approximately 2000 sq.m. area and total
            sanctioned staff strength of 44 comprising 28 members of faculty and
            16 supporting staff.
