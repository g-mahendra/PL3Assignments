1
00:00:01,038 --> 00:00:03,795
<i>Previously on "Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...</i>

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:06,493
What is that thing parading
around as Grant Ward?

3
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:08,428
He connects to the Inhumans,

4
00:00:08,462 --> 00:00:11,362
and they instantly joined the hive.

5
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:12,730
I have to get back to the base.

6
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:14,071
They have something we need.

7
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:15,967
Daisy showed me the Kree
artifact you gave her,

8
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:17,603
and it's missing its companion piece.

9
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:19,538
I buried it. What is it?

10
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:21,774
The only thing that can destroy me.

11
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:23,074
How do we disinfect Daisy?

12
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:24,742
Meet Dr. Holden Radcliffe.

13
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:26,498
You're the only one that
can save my friend.

14
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:32,115
With your help, we're going
to redefine humanity.

15
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:33,094
H-how could you...

16
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:35,912
By re-creating the same
Kree experiment that was done to me.

17
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:37,176
It was in that moment
my world had changed forever.

18
00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:43,584
The Kree Reapers brought
me back to their ship

19
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:47,120
and began the experiment.

20
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:55,427
I didn't know it then, but the Reapers

21
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:59,664
were using their own Kree
blood to transform my DNA.

22
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:03,368
Once they changed what I was,

23
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:05,203
the Reapers took the final step,

24
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,478
fulfilling the promise
of what I would become.

25
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,686
So that's how you became an Inhuman.

26
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:23,054
Myself and many others.

27
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:26,323
Put through the Kree
experiment thousands of years ago.

28
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:31,662
These first
Inhumans... they were your ancestors.

29
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:36,466
Your ancestors started Hydra.

30
00:02:36,502 --> 00:02:38,235
You fought to bring me back,

31
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,231
yet are the only
faithful to evade being captured

32
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:43,439
after Gideon
Malick's spineless betrayal.

33
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:46,709
Well... the time has
come for your reward.

34
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:48,478
Thank you, but...

35
00:02:48,513 --> 00:02:52,314
what does that have
to do with your story?

36
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:53,650
Isn't it obvious?

37
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:57,787
We've been working hard to
re-create the Kree experiment.

38
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:01,789
And you're next.

39
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:06,520


40
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,599
Any word on Daisy?

41
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:12,634
Nope.

42
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,836
You tried reaching
out to any old contacts?

43
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:16,371
- Uh-huh.
- Maybe if...

44
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:17,538
We're handling it.

45
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:19,139
I just want to help.

46
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:20,942
If I'm locked down on the base,

47
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:22,676
at least let me do something.

48
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:25,052
The last time you helped wasn't helpful.

49
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:28,582
Alisha had answers. I was
just trying to make her talk.

50
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:29,850
You threatened to torture her.

51
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:32,019
- How'd that work out?
- I'm not going to apologize

52
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:33,687
for trying to save someone I care about.

53
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:36,389
We all care about Daisy.

54
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,091
- Oh, it's not the same.
- No.

55
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:40,560
The rest of us have
known her a lot longer.

56
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,096
You really want to help?

57
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:45,298
Stop trying.

58
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,502
This is hopeless.

59
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:53,337
Just hold on, Simmons.

60
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:55,640
The antitoxin appears to be
fighting the Hive parasites.

61
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:56,942
Yes, but first,

62
00:03:56,978 --> 00:03:58,978
it would probably
destroy the host's immune system,

63
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,947
and who even knows how it
will react with Inhuman DNA?

64
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,016
Well, I'll admit that it's not ideal,

65
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:07,118
but what other choice do we have?

66
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:12,022
You didn't see Daisy.

67
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:14,025
She acted like we were
still best of pals,

68
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,727
all while threatening to murder me.

69
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:17,562
No, you're right. I didn't see that.

70
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:19,029
I was much too busy listening

71
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:21,865
to the disgusting face of Grant
Ward act like my dead boyfriend.

72
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:24,067
That's true. That does sound worse.

73
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:26,836
Right. If this was a
competition, I would win.

74
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:29,305
I had to shoot him three
times just to shut him up.

75
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,175
- Bet that felt good.
- Yeah, it did,

76
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,644
though it would have felt
better had he actually died,

77
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,478
instead of just sort of oozing.

78
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:38,281
What if Hive can't be killed?

79
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:41,250
What then?

80
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:43,451
This antitoxin might
be the best chance we have

81
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:45,120
to free Daisy of his hold on her.

82
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:47,523
Yes, or it could put her into
cardiac arrest or seizures.

83
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:49,257
Okay, but, then, we
find a way to test it.

84
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:50,826
And who's going to volunteer for that?

85
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:52,862
We need an Inhuman, and
those who aren't in hiding

86
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:55,064
are already under Hive's
sway and would kill us for trying.

87
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:57,266
I'll do it.

88
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,168
You can test it out on me.

89
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:31,264
Footage is from some
mechanic's garage in south Wyoming.

90
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,259
What's in south Wyoming?

91
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,665
Not much, by the looks of it.

92
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,000
Says it was an old mining town

93
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:36,569
that went through a natural-gas boom.

94
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:38,004
But with the influx of dirty wells,

95
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,439
it drove out almost all the locals.

96
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,572
And the ones that remained

97
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,240
were recently bought
out by a shell corporation.

98
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,576
- Owned by Malick.
- Yeah.

99
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:46,778
And now the town's
crawling with military.

100
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,348
It seems the personal guard

101
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,382
that we encountered in
Malick's hidden bunker...

102
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,451
They got out with Hive, relocated.

103
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,019
Won't be easy to grab Daisy.

104
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,956
You realize this is a trap, right?

105
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,124
Why?

106
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,557
W-W... Because we have a lead?

107
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,160
Because Daisy's a highly trained spy.

108
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,495
No S.H.I.E.L.D. agent would
get caught on camera that easily.

109
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,730
She's trying to draw us out.

110
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,665
Daisy warned Fitz not to
have S.H.I.E.L.D. follow.

111
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,266
Why would she want to lure us in now?

112
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,434
It doesn't add up.

113
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:11,567
None of this adds up.

114
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:12,870
There's an ancient Inhuman

115
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,738
controlling one of my best agents,

116
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,706
the same agent who helped reprogram

117
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:19,776
the facial-recognition software
that she just got flagged on.

118
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:20,810
What?

119
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:22,346
Suddenly, Daisy doesn't
know how it works?

120
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,081
Ohh, no, I don't... I
don't...  it's...

121
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:28,417
I th...

122
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:30,120
I think she wants us to rescue her.

123
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:31,788
- Mack.
- Look, just hear me out.

124
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:34,223
Daisy's too strong to give
up control without a fight.

125
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,026
I think there's a part of
her that's still resisting Hive.

126
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:39,327
That's just not the
reality. It's you projecting.

127
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:41,730
Look, Fitz said Daisy wasn't a zombie.

128
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,365
She's still herself, only
with Hive's agenda.

129
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,680
That means she's still in there.

130
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:46,334
I wish that was true, Mack, believe me,

131
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,250
but we cannot be driven
by our emotions on this.

132
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:49,713
That's how Ward ended up dead, which

133
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:51,040
is how we ended up in this mess.

134
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:52,040
Sir...

135
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:53,307
We don't have time to debate this.

136
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:54,909
You and I need to get on the same page.

137
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:57,646
Understood.

138
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,713
Good.

139
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:00,281
'Cause I'm sending a team in there,

140
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:01,716
and I want you and May to lead it.

141
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,584
So, then, we are saving Daisy.

142
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,185
This isn't a rescue
mission, Agent Mackenzie...

143
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:06,286
it's a targeted strike.

144
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:09,891
We're gonna kill Hive.

145
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:14,528
This town represents
the worst of humanity...

146
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:18,564
allowing the greed of a few
to destroy the needs of many.

147
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,434
Their water was
poisoned, which drove them out.

148
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:24,937
The great failing was their unwillingness
to band together.

149
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:28,074
Sometimes it's hard to join forces.

150
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,576
You need a good leader.

151
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:34,012
Like Coulson?

152
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:36,115
He was the reason
why I joined S.H.I.E.L.D.

153
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:38,183
S.H.I.E.L.D. is no
better than those Kree Reapers,

154
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:41,319
both making soldiers for
their never-ending wars.

155
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:45,757
My friends at
S.H.I.E.L.D. wanted to stop wars,

156
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:46,992
not start them.

157
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:49,360
By building giant
battleships floating in the sky?

158
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:53,497
The only reason
S.H.I.E.L.D. exists is to fight wars.

159
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,100
But isn't that why we exist?

160
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:56,574
I mean, that's what the Kree Reapers

161
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:57,701
were hoping to make, right?

162
00:07:57,737 --> 00:07:59,437
Soldiers.

163
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:03,074
Which is not what I became.

164
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,877
Sometimes, the world's
greatest miracles happen by accident.

165
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,848
The world I was born into was primitive.

166
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:14,718
It has evolved at a
remarkable pace while I was away.

167
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:17,788
So, what happened back then, to
get you kicked off of Earth?

168
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:20,490
People saw the connection
I had with other Inhumans,

169
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:22,091
and that made them afraid.

170
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,660
That fear bred
paranoia, which led to civil war.

171
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:26,327
Not much has changed, really.

172
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:30,832
Only now we have the ability
to re-create the Kree experiment.

173
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:33,836
Are the patients ready, Dr. Radcliffe?

174
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,837
Yes... not that you did us any favors

175
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:37,605
with your alien-abduction story.

176
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,274
Took a good hour to assure them

177
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,144
there'd be no probes of any sort.

178
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:44,544
Well, your method is much more elegant.

179
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:47,149
Not to mention more efficient,

180
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:49,250
now that I've added
the Terrigen Crystals

181
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:52,287
- to the prokaryotic compound.
- W...

182
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:54,721
You can change their
DNA and turn them Inhuman,

183
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:55,790
all at the same time?

184
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,957
Ah, the old one-two punch.

185
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:00,559
That particular bit of
ingenuity was my idea.

186
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:04,197
So... to the moment at hand.

187
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:06,432
The world fears our kind of power

188
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,335
because not everyone has it.

189
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,904
Only billionaires can build iron suits.

190
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,206
Only the military can
make super soldiers,

191
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:15,441
which can only lead to a war of its own,

192
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:20,446
whereas I plan to apply a
more, uh, collectivist philosophy.

193
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,716
Does, uh, does that
mean we can get started?

194
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,219
Yes.

195
00:09:26,254 --> 00:09:28,254
Right. Great.

196
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:44,302
Oh, God, please, make it stop!

197
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,849
How many others we got?

198
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:00,582
Four volunteers from operations...

199
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,719
aware of the danger and
all pretty gung ho.

200
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:05,087
Don't know if that'll be
enough to take out Hive.

201
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:06,255
Maybe not.

202
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,136
But lucky for us,

203
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:10,192
Coulson had Fitz open up the Cupboard.

204
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:12,193
Whoa! I got dibs on that.

205
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,562
Oh, sorry, O'Brien.

206
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:15,297
Coulson promised it
to me when I signed up.

207
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,932
It's in my contract.

208
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:19,500
Eyes up front, everyone.

209
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,436
Hive is unlike
anything we've ever faced,

210
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,304
which is why each of
you will be outfitted

211
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,306
with the best S.H.I.E.L.D.
has to offer...

212
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:27,741
full Kevlar Tac, heat-sensitive infrared,

213
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:28,876
and enough Splinter Bombs

214
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:30,745
to turn a small army into pixie dust.

215
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,947
The rest of the gear is up for grabs.

216
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:35,149
What's the Calvary packing?

217
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:37,350
- If I need a gun, I'll take one.
- No.

218
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,153
You'll be taking this one.

219
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:43,722
We can't leave anything to chance.

220
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,125
You seem extra motivated.

221
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:49,763
Daisy was my partner. This is on me.

222
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:52,231
Why is everyone making
this about themselves?

223
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:53,628
Because I should have seen it, May,

224
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:55,735
but between her Inhuman love connection

225
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,337
and me licking my wounds after
Bobbi and Hunter left,

226
00:10:58,373 --> 00:10:59,971
I took my eyes off the ball.

227
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:02,441
A good partner would've
seen that she was turned.

228
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:03,875
None of us saw it.

229
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:06,879
And you need to get your head straight.

230
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:09,081
This mission isn't about Daisy.

231
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:10,249
Agreed.

232
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:14,253
It's about me making things right.

233
00:11:19,558 --> 00:11:21,725
Wouldn't you have to be
infected with Hive's parasites

234
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,961
to test the antitoxin?

235
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:24,196
Not necessarily.

236
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,798
Simmons gives me the drug
first, takes my tissue sample,

237
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,499
then infects that with Hive's parasites.

238
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:30,600
This antitoxin will
destroy your immune system.

239
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:31,668
It could kill you.

240
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:32,956
You're not the only doctor here.

241
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:33,807
From what I can tell, the risks

242
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:34,904
aren't as high as what you're saying.

243
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:37,307
Don't pretend that's
really your medical opinion.

244
00:11:37,342 --> 00:11:38,642
I'm not pretending... you're
being overly cautious.

245
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:40,610
Yeah, and you're being a lovesick fool

246
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:42,312
trying to make a grand gesture.

247
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:45,048
Fitz... any thoughts?

248
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:48,552
Uh...

249
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:53,456
I agree with Simmons that
the antitoxin could be dangerous...

250
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,451
but I also think there's
a chance it could work.

251
00:11:57,361 --> 00:12:00,062
If Lincoln dies, do you
really want to be responsible?

252
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:02,664
No, of course I don't, but
this could save Daisy.

253
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,868
Daisy would never want
someone acting so recklessly

254
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:05,902
to save her.

255
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:08,169
Well, then, I'm glad it's not up to her.

256
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,711
I'm sorry, Agent Campbell.

257
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:19,780
Come on. Y-You got to reconsider.

258
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:20,883
My decision's final.

259
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:23,418
Fitz-Simmons, start
looking at other options.

260
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,952
We'll go from there.

261
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:41,100
Ohh!

262
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,735
One Martian Multi-ball,
three Bumper Blasters,

263
00:12:43,772 --> 00:12:45,504
and a 3-Way Rocket Combo.

264
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:46,572
Boom!

265
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,107
Good luck beating that score.

266
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,741
Better keep your hat on, Dundee,

267
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:52,144
'cause somebody don't
play when it comes to pinball.

268
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:55,948
Mmm. Ah!

269
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,750
This beer is bloody wonderful.

270
00:12:57,786 --> 00:12:59,918
I thought Aussies hated American beer.

271
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:01,753
Only when we got to pay for it.

272
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:05,024
It is good to be back in
the real world again.

273
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:06,725
Yeah, what made you go all Ted Kaczynski

274
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,725
in that trailer, anyway?

275
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,927
Don't know, really.

276
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:11,529
Just never found
people to be my cup of tea.

277
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:12,798
They didn't like me.

278
00:13:12,832 --> 00:13:15,499
I didn't like them, so I
thought I'd do everyone a favor

279
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:17,768
and move as far
away as humanly possible.

280
00:13:17,803 --> 00:13:20,404
That sounds pretty lonely.

281
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:22,773
Yeah.

282
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:24,908
Never really figured on that part.

283
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:26,110
Aww.

284
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:28,413
You're a little baby bird,

285
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,649
all fixed up and back in the wild.

286
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:33,015
I'm not keen on infantilizing,

287
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:35,332
but I would be willing to let
it slide for a proper dance.

288
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:36,286
Oh.

289
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:37,453
Oh! Whoo!

290
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:38,687
Okay.

291
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:40,889
Let's don't get your
rhinestones in a bunch, cowboy.

292
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:43,192
Let's just keep it to pinball.

293
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:46,296
Please tell me you're not pining
over Stinkin' Lincoln.

294
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:49,230
You know, James, just because you
don't care about anyone else

295
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,000
doesn't mean the rest of us don't.

296
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:53,101
Sorry. I didn't mean to offend.

297
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:56,238
It's just... you were S.H.I.E.L.D.

298
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:58,206
So those people you care
about are the same ones

299
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:00,208
that are trying to
stop what we're doing here.

300
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:01,177
It's not their fault.

301
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:02,644
They don't know any better.

302
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,047
Doesn't matter if they
know any better or not...

303
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:06,647
they're on the opposite side.

304
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:10,918
I can't see any way it
doesn't end badly for them.

305
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:15,023
There might be one way.

306
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:16,024
Oh, yeah?

307
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:17,924
And what's that?

308
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:22,629
We make them understand.

309
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,601
The genetic makeup of
Inhumans is incredibly complex.

310
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:31,004
We were bound to run into complications.

311
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,072
You assured me this would work.

312
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:34,341
Yes, and it would have

313
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:36,809
i-if I'd been provided with
the right ingredients.

314
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,145
Are you implying the mistake was mine?

315
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,846
No.

316
00:14:41,883 --> 00:14:44,384
No, no.

317
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:47,086
Well, yes, but it
wasn't an intentional mistake.

318
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:50,255
You see, the thing is, I
need DNA from a living Kree

319
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,357
to complete the genome sequence.

320
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:54,427
The DNA you gave me... your blood...

321
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:57,062
it's from a... dead host...

322
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,697
a handsome but dead host.

323
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,157
It's no good.

324
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:03,668
I mean, it's great for you,
but it... for this, it's no good.

325
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,238
If this were true, why are
you just telling me this now?

326
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,205
Ohh, I wasn't sure.

327
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,873
I was swept up in the moment!

328
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,875
I wanted to change the world!

329
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,278
And besides, you're very frightening.

330
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:16,013
Well, you are right to be scared.

331
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,182
I don't need you.

332
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,384
I can just kill you and
inhabit your body,

333
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,153
take your mind, your memories.

334
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,553
Yeah, that's a really bad idea.

335
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:24,888
You should ask my therapist.

336
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:27,224
My childhood was a total mess.

337
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,759
The swim team were not nice to me.

338
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:31,461
Plus, I can make this work.

339
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:34,297
Why should I believe you?

340
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,331
Because I want it to work.

341
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,067
This is game-changing stuff...

342
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:40,769
kick-starting mankind into a new gear.

343
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:43,706
Everything I've
done leading up to this...

344
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,240
it just pales.

345
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:52,447
I promise, you won't regret this.

346
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:54,749
I'm your guy.

347
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:59,087
Yeah, I've been meaning to...

348
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:01,956
been meaning to ask about those.

349
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:04,725
What are they for, exactly?

350
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:08,528
If you were scared before...

351
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,530
you should be terrified now.

352
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:19,005
Our intelligence suggests

353
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,274
there's at least 40
enemy combatants on the ground.

354
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:22,774
And what about Hive?

355
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:24,911
We've still yet to
verify his location, sir.

356
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:26,078
Okay.

357
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:29,948
The plan's simple... go
in, kill Hive, get out.

358
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:32,619
What's protocol when it comes
to the other Inhumans in town?

359
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,988
Do not engage unless
absolutely necessary.

360
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:36,755
These people are under Hive's control.

361
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,024
We don't want to hurt them.

362
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:39,424
I can't be with you on the ground,

363
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,427
but I will be
watching your helmet feeds.

364
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:43,928
Be careful and be smart.

365
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,865
This may be our only
chance to catch Hive by surprise.

366
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:49,934
And worst-case scenario,
if Hive can't be killed?

367
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,606
I suggest running... very fast... away.

368
00:16:58,544 --> 00:16:59,677
Jemma...

369
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:04,749
are we good after, you
know, our disagreement?

370
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:06,250
Oh, yeah, of course we're good.

371
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:08,685
If I wanted a boyfriend who agreed
with everything I said,

372
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:10,521
I never would have
broken up with Milton.

373
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:11,821
Ugh...

374
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,156
Milton!

375
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:17,294
He was the absolute worst,

376
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:22,432
what with his stupid, fat
cabbage head of his.

377
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:23,767
"Hi. I'm... Hi. I'm Milton."

378
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:25,568
More like a Brussels sprout, really.

379
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:27,304
But Milton's odd-shaped head aside,

380
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,705
we should make a point to
never let work disagreements

381
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,174
affect our relationship outside of work.

382
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,711
Couldn't agree more,
Simmons, especially since we both know

383
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:37,547
who tends to be right most of the time.

384
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:39,448
Oh, I assume you're referring to the one

385
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:41,916
who finished top of our
class at S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.

386
00:17:41,951 --> 00:17:44,086
Now, that is a sore
point, because we both know

387
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:47,088
that if I'd just stayed
up and studied all night...

388
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:48,522
Lincoln.

389
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,926
I'm tired of arguing.

390
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:55,262
Lincoln, no!

391
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,294
Lincoln. Hey. Lincoln.

392
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:10,865
Look at me. Look at me!

393
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:13,667
I just want to help.

394
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:14,801
This is an elixir,

395
00:18:14,837 --> 00:18:16,471
and it will hopefully
counter the antitoxin.

396
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:17,480
N-No.

397
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:18,559
It's gonna work.

398
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,941
We don't have time for
this. Your body is shutting down.

399
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:21,909
I can handle it.

400
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:25,179
Please... just let me do this.

401
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:35,923
You got eyes on this, Coulson?

402
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:36,990
Affirmative.

403
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:39,858
There's no sign of Hive anywhere.

404
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:42,261
We don't have time to
search the entire town.

405
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:48,634
Isn't that the Inhuman Hive
picked up in South Dakota?

406
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,037
Yeah, he's a real blowhard.

407
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:55,140
That might work.

408
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:03,949
Hey, this area's authorized

409
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:05,049
for Hydra personnel only.

410
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:06,718
Who the hell are you?

411
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:09,121
Hello, gorgeous.

412
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:10,788
I'm James.

413
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:13,124
Single, 33, originally from Brisbane.

414
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:15,226
I'm a Leo, with a little dab of Scorpio

415
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,094
thrown in there for good measure.

416
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,895
I like a decent drink, a decent meal,

417
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:19,863
and an indecent lass,

418
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:22,900
and not necessarily in that order.

419
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:24,301
And you are...?

420
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:25,868
Nauseous...

421
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:26,903
Mm.

422
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,538
And wondering what you're doing here.

423
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:30,705
Uh, you're definitely not Hydra.

424
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:32,075
Mnh-mnh.

425
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,843
This means they brought in
other contractors since Malick died?

426
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:34,911
Ah!

427
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:36,278
A contractor? Really?

428
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:38,147
Is that what I look like to you?

429
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:40,482
Listen, big shot, this isn't a game.

430
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:43,153
I need you to tell me
what you're doing here.

431
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:44,653
I'd rather show than tell.

432
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:01,170
Y-Y-You're... You're one of them.

433
00:20:01,204 --> 00:20:02,304
That's right.

434
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,805
Kind of hand-picked by
the big man himself.

435
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,607
Kind of a number-one draft
pick, if you will.

436
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:09,542
I had no idea. Please,
you have to forgive me.

437
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:13,146
Have a drink with me, and
I might consider it.

438
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:17,352
You're not too bad for security.

439
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:18,987
Little icy.

440
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:21,253
Lucky for me, I don't get frostbite.

441
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:24,057
Were you like this before
you got your powers?

442
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:25,625
What... 101% awesome?

443
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,792
You bet.

444
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:29,229
Becoming Inhuman doesn't
change your personality.

445
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:30,230
Who knows?

446
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:32,199
Might even see for yourself one day.

447
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:37,603
Uh, the big man... he's
working on this experiment

448
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:40,538
turning humans into Inhumans, huh?

449
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:41,940
Ask nicely...

450
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:44,843
might even help you to
the front of the line.

451
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:49,347
That must be why
Hive grabbed Radcliffe...

452
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:50,781
to make his army.

453
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:51,916
Stay on alert.

454
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,486
You hear what Coulson just said?

455
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,519
Yeah, sorry.

456
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,686
I was just wondering
if there was a chance

457
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,522
this guy doesn't get his ass whupped.

458
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,991
Not a chance.

459
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,595
Alisha said you wanted to see me.

460
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,132
You and I share similar paths.

461
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,835
We were both created by outside forces.

462
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,536
I'm not sure I'm following.

463
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,238
My powers were given by the Kree...

464
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,204
yours by S.H.I.E.L.D.

465
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,106
They're the ones who made us.

466
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,776
Why are you worried about S.H.I.E.L.D.?

467
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:27,084
Because I'm curious if you
can defeat what made you.

468
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,486
The people at
S.H.I.E.L.D. are my friends.

469
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:32,221
Friends who will turn on you,

470
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,923
who will try and
sabotage the connection we share.

471
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,858
Only because they don't understand,

472
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:39,827
but they will if we can make
them share our connection.

473
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:42,897
You want to put your
friends through the Kree experiment.

474
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:45,534
Once Radcliffe has worked
out the kinks, yeah.

475
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:47,536
Yeah, I do.

476
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,738
They may not be receptive to that idea.

477
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:52,273
Well, I have to at least try.

478
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:54,375
It's the only way we can save them.

479
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:58,447
And what if you fail,

480
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:00,647
if they decide to turn on you instead,

481
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:03,116
to come after us
with their weapons of war,

482
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:07,555
to kill me, to kill all of us?

483
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:09,256
What then?

484
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:13,394
Then I would rip their hearts out.

485
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:17,298
Hearing that comes as a relief,

486
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:22,535
especially now that
our plans have changed.

487
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:25,671
I'm sorry.

488
00:22:25,707 --> 00:22:27,873
There was just no other choice.

489
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:30,843
We both thought it was
the right thing to do.

490
00:22:30,877 --> 00:22:32,010
Hey.

491
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:34,314
Don't act as if we're
on the same side on this.

492
00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:37,516
Coulson gave you a direct
order, and you disobeyed.

493
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,884
Now... half the lab's
computers are fried,

494
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:43,788
not to mention the blown servers.

495
00:22:43,824 --> 00:22:46,825
I'm sorry about that. Really, I am.

496
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:49,728
But the antitoxin is gonna work.

497
00:22:49,762 --> 00:22:51,061
I can feel it.

498
00:22:51,097 --> 00:22:53,963
Well, we won't know until Simmons
has run some more tests.

499
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,400
And for that, I'll need to
drill inside your head.

500
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:57,468
Wait.

501
00:22:57,503 --> 00:23:01,204
The tissue sample you
need is from my brain?

502
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:04,708
That's correct... something
you would have known,

503
00:23:04,743 --> 00:23:07,377
had you asked questions
instead of going behind our backs.

504
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:09,346
He's all yours, Doctor.

505
00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:15,884
He sounds pretty amazing.

506
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,186
Oh, yeah.

507
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:21,723
He's got this whole Ziggy Stardust
vibe thing happening.

508
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,925
It's... It's quite epic.

509
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:26,462
Well, I would love to meet him.

510
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:30,065
Well, I just might be able to
broker an introduction for you.

511
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,701
Right now?

512
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:34,269
You'd really do that for me?

513
00:23:34,305 --> 00:23:37,939
Not so sure if right now works.

514
00:23:37,974 --> 00:23:39,294
I mean, he's kind of a busy guy, with

515
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:40,542
changing the world and everything.

516
00:23:40,577 --> 00:23:41,644
Right.

517
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,744
No, no, no. Don't go
rainy-day blues on me.

518
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,247
He might still be in that
abandoned mining facility.

519
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:50,652
You got that?

520
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:55,056
On our way!

521
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,792
Why take over a town
and then move to the outskirts?

522
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:01,162
I don't know, but the
reason's probably not good.

523
00:24:01,196 --> 00:24:02,695
Remember, this is Hive.

524
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,963
Be prepared to go in hot. Safeties off.

525
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,833
They were never on, sir.

526
00:24:09,672 --> 00:24:11,871
I was hoping to spare you this,

527
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:14,106
but it was the only way.

528
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:16,041
They're coming for us.

529
00:24:17,144 --> 00:24:18,977
You hearing this?

530
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:20,445
Sounds like some kind of radio.

531
00:24:24,818 --> 00:24:27,051
What?

532
00:24:29,324 --> 00:24:31,656
That's definitely no
radio I've ever seen.

533
00:24:31,692 --> 00:24:33,726
I've seen that writing before.

534
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,527
Sir.

535
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,497
Get everyone out of there now!

536
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:41,499
You heard him! Move out! Go! Go!

537
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:43,835
- Move it!
- Who's coming?

538
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:44,868
S.H.I.E.L.D.?

539
00:24:44,903 --> 00:24:47,239
Not the ones who made you...

540
00:24:47,273 --> 00:24:49,708
the ones who made me.

541
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:51,576
Move! Go, go, go!

542
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:01,285
What the hell was that?

543
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,019
The Kree.

544
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:19,506
The Kree are here?

545
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:20,974
How did they even find us?

546
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:22,409
I sent them a signal.

547
00:25:22,444 --> 00:25:24,278
The artifacts from James' trailer.

548
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:25,880
Are a failsafe to be used

549
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:28,480
if the Inhuman
experiment ever got out of control.

550
00:25:28,516 --> 00:25:30,951
In case of emergency,
call Kree headquarters.

551
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:33,252
These Kree are not
from their home world.

552
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:35,087
They're Reapers.

553
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:37,990
They exist only to hunt.

554
00:25:38,026 --> 00:25:40,292
And to find humans for your makers.

555
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:43,028
For thousands of years, they've
remained in stasis,

556
00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:44,363
orbiting our solar system.

557
00:25:44,397 --> 00:25:46,597
So they're coming here to do what...

558
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:47,732
clean up their mess?

559
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:50,335
These are the only
things that can defeat you.

560
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:52,003
Those are your exact words.

561
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:53,739
The Reapers are my greatest fear,

562
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:57,509
but with your help, I believe we will...

563
00:25:57,544 --> 00:25:59,478
rip out their hearts.

564
00:25:59,512 --> 00:26:01,444
Those words are yours.

565
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,080
That's really not what I meant.

566
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:04,115
I fought a Kree before.

567
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:05,583
They won't be easy to kill.

568
00:26:05,617 --> 00:26:08,118
These Reapers are even deadlier,

569
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:11,256
which will make your
task more difficult.

570
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,589
My task?

571
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,125
For this experiment to work,

572
00:26:14,161 --> 00:26:17,560
we need blood from a living Kree.

573
00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:20,396
And I want you to get it.

574
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:27,237
Was that a spaceship?

575
00:26:27,272 --> 00:26:30,339
It's too small... looks
like more of a satellite.

576
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:31,942
Why am I not relieved?

577
00:26:33,244 --> 00:26:34,544
You find anything?

578
00:26:34,578 --> 00:26:37,413
Just debris everywhere and
some really big footprints.

579
00:26:37,448 --> 00:26:39,315
Like alien footprints, right?

580
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,548
That's what we're talking about here?

581
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:41,583
Great.

582
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:43,318
Now we have more
players to contend with.

583
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:44,886
The frickin' aliens just landed.

584
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:45,798
We're not... We're not gonna take

585
00:26:45,823 --> 00:26:46,622
a moment and let that soak in?

586
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:50,392
Well, the question is,
whose side are they on?

587
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:54,362
Dude, run! Go!

588
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,432
Inhuman.

589
00:26:58,468 --> 00:27:02,470
Actually, that's Inhumans, plural.

590
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,584
No!

591
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:27,826
You should be proud
of what we've become.

592
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,960
He's taking out Hydra agents.

593
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:36,481
Or everything he comes across.

594
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:39,972
This will be a lot easier
if that guy's on our side.

595
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:42,441
Why would Hive signal these things?

596
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:45,978
Maybe he's hoping to form
some sort of creepy dude alliance.

597
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:49,314
These things are hunters, not allies.

598
00:27:49,349 --> 00:27:50,815
Coulson, what are our orders?

599
00:27:50,851 --> 00:27:52,116
Follow at a close distance,

600
00:27:52,152 --> 00:27:54,019
but stay out of that
thing's cross hairs.

601
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:00,892
It senses something in that church.

602
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:02,259
Yeah, my money's on Hive.

603
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,829
Daisy.

604
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:08,565
Those aren't our orders.

605
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:11,468
- Mack.
- I got to try.

606
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:14,137
I'll meet you at the extraction point.

607
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:26,048
That wasn't me.

608
00:28:28,685 --> 00:28:30,153
Inhuman filth.

609
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,936
You said you were going
to handle this thing.

610
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:50,338
- Now we are both gonna die!
- Nobody's dying here today.

611
00:29:04,586 --> 00:29:07,121
What was that last sound?

612
00:29:07,156 --> 00:29:08,621
The spine.

613
00:29:08,656 --> 00:29:10,289
Now drain it.

614
00:29:16,198 --> 00:29:19,098
I've spent a thousand
years wondering what would happen

615
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,067
should the blue angels ever return.

616
00:29:25,272 --> 00:29:27,705
You're smaller than I remember.

617
00:29:30,326 --> 00:29:33,211
Now's our chance to go in and unload

618
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:34,880
while Papa Smurf's got him distracted.

619
00:29:34,914 --> 00:29:35,913
Stand down.

620
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,250
The Kree might just do the job for us.

621
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:40,318
We don't have to fight.

622
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:42,252
I'm still grateful to you for making me.

623
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:43,753
We should not have chosen you.

624
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:46,757
That was providence guiding your hand.

625
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:49,361
Then what guides my hand now?

626
00:29:58,038 --> 00:29:58,970
Poor guy.

627
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,671
He doesn't have much longer.

628
00:30:01,707 --> 00:30:03,772
Will there be enough blood
for the experiment to work?

629
00:30:03,808 --> 00:30:05,976
Yeah, absolutely. I
mean, you were fantastic.

630
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:08,278
We should have all we
need in the next hour.

631
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:09,953
In fact, I'm happy to take it from here.

632
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:11,882
I-I-If you've got somewhere
else you need to be,

633
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:13,083
then feel free to...

634
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:15,184
She's coming with me.

635
00:30:16,554 --> 00:30:18,921
I told Fitz to stay away.

636
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:19,855
No can do...

637
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:22,290
not when my partner needs help.

638
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:23,759
I don't need your help.

639
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:26,528
There's plenty of
evidence here to the contrary.

640
00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:28,297
You don't understand.

641
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,965
I'm doing this to help you.

642
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:33,634
And now is murdering a
blue alien gonna help me?

643
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,037
It's the only way to save you.

644
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,830
We're gonna make you into an Inhuman.

645
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:45,558
This isn't you.

646
00:30:45,713 --> 00:30:47,890
I know this is hard for
you to hear, but this is me.

647
00:30:47,924 --> 00:30:49,190
I'm not lost anymore.

648
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:51,586
Everyone at S.H.I.E.L.D. can finally
stop trying to save me.

649
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:53,260
- This is different.
- Is it?

650
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:55,963
I mean, first, S.H.I.E.L.D. rescues
me from the Rising Tide,

651
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,266
and then from my
admittedly not-so-great parents,

652
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,467
and now, once again,

653
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:01,869
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s rallied the
troops to save poor Daisy.

654
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:03,337
Because you're sick.

655
00:31:03,373 --> 00:31:05,239
That... thing is a parasite.

656
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:07,473
It's messing with your head.

657
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:09,143
That's what S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been doing.

658
00:31:09,178 --> 00:31:10,144
Look at us, Mack!

659
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:12,680
You were a mechanic, I was a hacker,

660
00:31:12,714 --> 00:31:14,314
and now, s-somehow, we're soldiers?

661
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:16,683
The world's changing. We had to adapt.

662
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:17,751
We had no choice.

663
00:31:17,787 --> 00:31:20,287
S.H.I.E.L.D. made us
into what it needed.

664
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:21,422
No.

665
00:31:21,457 --> 00:31:23,589
Nobody at
S.H.I.E.L.D. made you do anything.

666
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:25,357
But Coulson knew I was lost,

667
00:31:25,393 --> 00:31:27,693
so he'd offered up his
team of misfit toys

668
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:29,394
just to fill that emptiness.

669
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:30,997
That team cares about you.

670
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,134
I care about you.

671
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,336
So what's that make us... friends?

672
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:41,506
Friends. Partners.

673
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,141
Bobbi was your partner once.

674
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:44,409
How'd that work out for you?

675
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,778
You know damn well Bobbi and
Hunter left S.H.I.E.L.D.

676
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:47,078
to protect us.

677
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,748
They left S.H.I.E.L.D.
because there was no reason to stay,

678
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:52,116
because nobody else at S.H.I.E.L.D.
mattered to them.

679
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:55,019
It wasn't hard to leave.

680
00:31:56,422 --> 00:32:00,057
But I think you should
leave here, right now.

681
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:16,772
Part of you wants to come back.

682
00:32:16,808 --> 00:32:18,709
That's how we found you.

683
00:32:18,743 --> 00:32:20,343
What are you talking about?

684
00:32:20,377 --> 00:32:21,644
Three hours ago,

685
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,681
we received security
footage of you outside this garage.

686
00:32:24,717 --> 00:32:26,449
It sent a red flag up our system,

687
00:32:26,484 --> 00:32:28,852
the same system you helped create.

688
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,788
So what... you think
that I meant for this to happen?

689
00:32:34,191 --> 00:32:37,058
It wasn't an accident.

690
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:39,694
Something inside you is resisting.

691
00:32:41,132 --> 00:32:45,067
I slipped up because I
wasn't thinking like a spy anymore,

692
00:32:45,103 --> 00:32:48,869
because I don't need to be a
S.H.I.E.L.D. agent anymore.

693
00:32:48,904 --> 00:32:50,438
- Tremors...
- No, no, Mack.

694
00:32:50,472 --> 00:32:51,972
I cared about you, too.

695
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,207
After what happened with my parents,

696
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:55,442
I needed someone, and you...

697
00:32:55,478 --> 00:32:58,546
you were almost
like a big brother to me.

698
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,714
But let's be honest...

699
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,717
you struggle to be a real brother

700
00:33:02,752 --> 00:33:04,451
to the one that you have.

701
00:33:04,486 --> 00:33:06,185
Leave Ruben out of this.

702
00:33:06,221 --> 00:33:08,788
I understand how you're feeling.

703
00:33:09,858 --> 00:33:12,859
But you don't need to
feel alone anymore.

704
00:33:12,894 --> 00:33:13,993
We can fix it.

705
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:16,130
Now, what you're
feeling... it's not real.

706
00:33:16,164 --> 00:33:19,732
What we feel is reality.

707
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:21,667
It's the way the world was meant to be.

708
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:23,169
Not my world.

709
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:27,640
I really wanted to save you, Mack.

710
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:30,308
Yeah.

711
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:33,846
Me, too.

712
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:41,787
If I can't save you, I guess
I'll save everyone else.

713
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:48,526
I'm no longer the scared
hunter you took all those years ago.

714
00:33:58,304 --> 00:33:59,670
You should have stayed away!

715
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,672
Wait!

716
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,974
Please.

717
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,711
I'm not gonna fight you.

718
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:30,699
I wanted you to be a part of this.

719
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,242
Big Blue might just have this one.

720
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,409
Don't be so sure.

721
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:44,512
Sounds like Hive's nursing
a thousand-year grudge.

722
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:48,949
You made something great...

723
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,119
something divine...

724
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,554
and now you want to destroy it.

725
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:01,295
You are a failed experiment.

726
00:35:07,735 --> 00:35:12,371
Sometimes, the world's
greatest miracles happen by accident.

727
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,280
Take the shot... now! Repeat!

728
00:35:22,315 --> 00:35:23,547
Take the shot!

729
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,391
Piper!

730
00:35:45,438 --> 00:35:46,670
We have to go! Now!

731
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:48,505
Now!

732
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,916
We could have had a
connection that was real.

733
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:03,853
Daisy, look at yourself.

734
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:05,889
You don't have to do this.

735
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:13,829
I need emergency evac now!

736
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:26,842
We got to get out of
here! Hurry up! He's coming!

737
00:36:26,878 --> 00:36:30,144
He's coming!

738
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:59,505
I can't believe Daisy did this.

739
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:04,409
You were right about her.

740
00:37:04,445 --> 00:37:06,478
Really wish I wasn't.

741
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:07,545
So...

742
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:12,318
Hive wants to turn any
human into an Inhuman,

743
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:16,389
regardless of that
person's existing genetic markers.

744
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:17,623
Might have succeeded,

745
00:37:17,657 --> 00:37:19,958
had Mack not Splinter Bombed that Kree.

746
00:37:19,994 --> 00:37:21,159
Well, does it even matter?

747
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:25,396
That thing... there's
nothing that can stop it.

748
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:35,873
Wait.

749
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:37,440
What happened?

750
00:37:37,476 --> 00:37:39,010
Is Daisy okay?

751
00:37:39,045 --> 00:37:40,643
The mission failed.

752
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,380
Daisy is still alive,

753
00:37:42,414 --> 00:37:43,981
but they weren't able to stop Hive.

754
00:37:44,918 --> 00:37:47,918
W-When did this happen?

755
00:37:47,954 --> 00:37:50,186
They returned an hour ago.

756
00:37:51,657 --> 00:37:53,688
An hour ago?

757
00:37:53,724 --> 00:37:56,092
And you just...

758
00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:58,228
kept me down here this whole time?

759
00:37:58,262 --> 00:37:59,494
Well, you needed to rest.

760
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,831
I needed to be up there, helping,

761
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,567
not locked down here like some prisoner!

762
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:06,402
Your immune system is
completely shut down!

763
00:38:06,438 --> 00:38:08,405
Anyone so much as
sneezes, and it might kill you.

764
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,405
So until you've fully recovered,

765
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,010
you are a
prisoner... you're my prisoner.

766
00:38:17,414 --> 00:38:20,349
I'm sorry.

767
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:26,021
I-I just don't know what to do.

768
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:28,389
None of us do.

769
00:38:29,692 --> 00:38:33,293
Did you at least tell
Coulson we might have a cure?

770
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:36,097
No.

771
00:38:36,132 --> 00:38:37,965
Why not?

772
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:41,101
Because we don't.

773
00:38:41,137 --> 00:38:42,869
That's what I came down to tell you...

774
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,704
the antitoxin...

775
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,405
it didn't work.

776
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,211
Now get some rest.

777
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:04,856
I ripped out its heart...

778
00:39:04,891 --> 00:39:07,059
as discussed.

779
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:11,597
But you failed us.

780
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:13,032
I tried to stop him.

781
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:14,967
Then your efforts were lacking.

782
00:39:15,003 --> 00:39:17,402
Not only did your
friend destroy everything

783
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,338
we've been working
towards, he also got away.

784
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:24,376
We put too much trust in you.

785
00:39:24,411 --> 00:39:28,278
Your ties to S.H.I.E.L.D. are
stronger than you admit.

786
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:30,847
Leaves me with questions.

787
00:39:34,054 --> 00:39:36,952
No.

788
00:39:36,989 --> 00:39:39,722
You were right to trust me.

789
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:42,692
I'm finished with S.H.I.E.L.D.

790
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:45,561
And actually, I have answers.

791
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:48,565
The DNA you need... I have it.

792
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,134
Inhuman DNA is not enough.

793
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,135
We needed to drain actual Kree blood.

794
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,702
Which is what I have pumping
through my veins.

795
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:58,173
Coulson used it to bring
me back after Quinn shot me.

796
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,775
Ward should remember.

797
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:02,545
He does.

798
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:08,251
So, if you want this
experiment to work...

799
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:10,362
drain me.

800
